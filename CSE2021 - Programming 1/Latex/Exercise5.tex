\textbf{Implement these functions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a function f(x): $f(x) = x^{2} + 2x$ 
    \item Derivative of the function: $f'(x) = 2x + 2$
    \item Forward difference approximation: $f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$
    \item Central difference approximation: $f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\frac{\Delta x}{2}) - f(x - \frac{\Delta x}{2})}{\Delta x}$
\end{enumerate}
